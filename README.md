# Visual-Doorbell-Alert-System-for-Hearing-Assistance
This project creates a sound-reactive lighting system using Arduino Leonardo and a MAX9814 microphone amplifier. The analog signal is sampled to calculate peak-to-peak amplitude, and when sound intensity exceeds a set threshold, a NeoPixel LED strip turns on, demonstrating real-time embedded signal sampling and hardware control.
